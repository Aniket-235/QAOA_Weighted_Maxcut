# QAOA_Weighted_Maxcut

MaxCut problem — given a graph, find a way to divide it into two groups, such that the edges going between the two groups have the biggest possible weight. <br>
This code is generalised solution for weighted maxcut by introducing minor changes in [the code for unweighted graph](https://lucaman99.github.io/new_blog/2020/mar16.html) by [Jack Ceroni](https://lucaman99.github.io/)
